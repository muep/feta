Feta - Hours tracking tool

Feta is a library and a tool for creating a list of sessions
into a file and generating reports from them.

Feta is currently hosted at Gitorious [1].

* Dependencies
Currently Feta requires only GNU Guile [2] and libraries
included in it.

As of writing this, Guile 1.8 is the version of Guile that
is most often shipped as part of GNU/Linux distributions.
Guile 2.0 series, however, has been available for some time
and it really provides some great enhancements over the 1.8
series.

All Feta modules work just fine with Guile 1.8, but some, in
particular the web related ones use modules which only
became part of Guile in later releases. So unless you can
provide a suitable (sxml simple) and the various (web
something) modules used in (feta xml) and
test/dummyserver.scm, some functionality require Guile 2.0
or later in practice.

* Getting it running
The feta.scm script and the possible others with a shebang
line otherwise work, but you probably do not wish to copy
the modules of Feta right into the paths from which your
copy of Guile loads its modules. It would at least be
recommended to package the modules before doing so, to
facilitate easy uninstallation.

So unless you are much into packaging stuff, you probably
need to tell Guile about the additional paths from which to
load modules. The easiest way to do it is to set the
GUILE_LOAD_PATH environment variable to point to a place
that contains the Feta module hierarchy, which is in the
modules/ directory of the feta project root.

Thus, if the feta project root is your current working
directory, you might run feta.scm like this:

 env GUILE_LOAD_PATH=./modules/ ./feta.scm

* Notes about packaging
First, the project is really not very mature. It is far from
feature-complete, very badly documented and is likely to
keep changing a lot in the near future. It may not make
sense to package it just yet.

I really have no idea about what kind of a build/install
system a Guile-based application should have, but I intend
to probably add something when I know what I want. As long
as there is no such a system, a packager would need to make
educated guesses about what to put where and if some files
need preprocessing. So here is an initial look at how the
package contents might look.

feta.scm without the suffix in filename:
/usr/bin/feta

module hierarchy copied to /usr/share/guile/site/:
/usr/share/guile/site/feta/session.scm
/usr/share/guile/site/feta/time-range.scm
...

This should be enough for feta to work as intended.
Other files may be contained according to OS packaging
conventions.
